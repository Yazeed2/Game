## Planning and Development Process

Day -1

### Problem-Solving Strategy

- I made sure to look at the console when having errors and read the error.

- Take a break whenever I feel overwelming 

- 
### Unsolved problems

- I could not figure out how to make a score baord using fs that can work in the browser during the time limitation
- there was not time to make an AI enemies 
- I made two leverls but I could not make 5 diffrent levels because of the time constrains
- fixing all gliches and ways that others can cheat inside the game because I don't have enough data
