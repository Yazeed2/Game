## Planning and Development Process

Day -1
- Created a simple animation usning javascript with editing the posstion from css.

- made the on mouse hover function 

Day 1
- Created a loop that can animate an object multiple times 

- Created a function that can animate more than one object

- Wrote a function that can randomise the direction in wich the object is going to

- Helped others with thier projects

Day 2
- Changed the game physics and made this game addictive 

- Created an outer border that doesn't allow users to cheat 

- Added a score feature

Day 4
- Comented the Javascript code 

- Made the presentation 

- writing this documentation 

### Problem-Solving Strategy

- Google it


- I made sure to look at the console when having errors and read the error.

- Take a break whenever I feel overwelming 

- console.log() //every step

- Comment and delet some code

- Ask for help 


### Unsolved problems

- I could not figure out how to make a score baord using fs that can work in the browser during the time limitation

- There was not time to make an AI enemies 

- I made two leverls but I could not make 5 diffrent levels because of the time constrains

- Fixing all gliches and ways that others can cheat inside the game because I don't have enough data
